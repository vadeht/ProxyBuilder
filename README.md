# Proxy Builder
**NOT READY YET! DON'T CLONE THIS!**
Currently if you want to make proxies, you either rip Scryfall scans (low quality) or build manually with Photoshop and custom fonts (too much work). ProxyBuilder allows you to get the best of both worlds. Import a card list and watch as Magic happens. Proxy Builder uses python3 and PIL to create proxies with the quality of photoshop with the ease of sites like MTGPress.net!

## Usage
Clone the repo, modify cards.txt with a decklist (a rip from tappedout is supported, but probably anything is supported). 

python3 ProxyBuilder.py

## Requirements
 - Requests
